"Since the MusicBo KG has been extracted automatically, there are mistakes like the following: San Petronio, which is  the name of the main basilica in Bologna, is marked as a city.  That resulted in the mistake in the counter. The counter for  orchestras mentioned with Bologna should have showed a  different number: only three results of orchestras' names. What’s more, two of them definitely referred to the same  orchestra name but with a different spelling. We attempted to establish a connection between  orchestras and people mentioned. With additional variable, we retrieved results, but they  referred to San Petronio as a person or as a name for  the orchestra. We decided to explore this connection  using a more extensive KG, namely Wikidata.",data availability,data sources,Negative
