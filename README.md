# storyviz-data-sparql-lab

## Notebooks analysing data storytelling practices, data visualisation, and SPARQL proficiency

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks developed as part of an ongoing research project focused on data storytelling in the context of the Semantic Web. The work explores how data visualisation, narrative structures, and SPARQL querying skills intersect to support both the creation and interpretation of data-driven stories.

## Objectives

- Analyse the structure and components of data stories created using Semantic Web technologies.
- Investigate the role of SPARQL queries in shaping visual and narrative outputs.
- Explore the potential of data storytelling as a tool for fostering data and Semantic Web literacy.

## Contents

### `data_stories_summary.json`

A structured summary of multiple data stories created by students using SPARQL and Wikidata. Each entry includes:
- The **title** of the story  
- The **SPARQL endpoint** used (mostly Wikidata)  
- (The **authors and curators** have been exclulded for anonomity)
- The **sequence and types** of elements (e.g. text, visualisations, counts, searches)  
- The **types of visualisations** used (bar charts, doughnut charts, tables, maps, etc.)  
- The **SPARQL queries** themselves  
- The **narrative texts** associated with each story

This file serves as a foundational dataset for evaluating user approaches to query design, visualisation strategy, and narrative structuring in educational or exploratory settings.

### `semantic_web_storytelling_analysis.ipynb`

A published notebook that supports the analysis presented in a paper on Semantic Web storytelling. It includes:
- Quantitative analysis of story structure and components  
- Categorisation of SPARQL queries and their roles in narratives  
- Visualisation patterns and their narrative functions  
- Preliminary conclusions on user proficiency and storytelling strategies  

### `data_stories.ipynb`

An early, exploratory notebook that served as the starting point for the project. It contains:
- Initial parsing and inspection of data story components  
- Manual observations and hypothesis formation  
- Unstructured experimentation with SPARQL queries, visual elements, and JSON structure  
- Basis for more structured analyses in later notebooks
