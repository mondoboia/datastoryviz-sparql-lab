## Notebooks on data storytelling, visualisation, and SPARQL proficiency

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks supporting a study of how Humanities students develop SPARQL skills, data visualisation literacy, and storytelling quality using the MELODY platform.

## Objectives
- Analyse structure and components of student-authored data stories.  
- Examine how SPARQL proficiency relates to storytelling quality and visualisation use.  
- Explore collaboration and perception in learning SPARQL.  

## Contents

### Data
- **`data_stories_summary.json`** – Structured summary of 51 anonymised data stories.

### Exploratory Analyses
- **`ead_components.ipynb`** – Story composition (elements, sequence, structure).    
- **`ead_text.ipynb`** – Story text length, placement, and closing sections.  
- **`ead_sparql_queries.ipynb`** – Analysis of SPARQL endpoints, query correctness, and feature use.  

### Exploratory Correlation and Cluster Analysis
- **`sparql_proficiency.ipynb`** – Composite metric for query correctness, feature use, diversity, and federation. 
- **`good_structure.ipynb`** – Alternation score for balance between text and visuals. 
- **`readability.ipynb`** – Text readability (Flesch Reading Ease).
- **`coherence.ipynb`** – Narrative coherence via sentence embeddings.
- **`info_density.ipynb`** – Information density from TF-IDF scores. 
- **`data_viz.ipynb`** – Use of visualisation types and their relationships with other metrics. 
- **`curators.ipynb`** – Effects of collaboration on story quality and SPARQL skills.

### Students Feedback analysis 
- **`sentiment_analysis.ipynb`** – Sentiment analysis of student feedback.

### Previous Work
