It is precisely its popularity that makes this genre so worthy of further study.

So when Shakespeare's Globe Theatre was built in 1997, it had to seek special permission to replicate the thatched roof of Shakespeare's day.</p>",

The original Globe Theatre was built in 1599 in London, England, by Shakespeare's playing company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men. It was situated on the south bank of the River Thames in the suburb of Southwark.</p><p>The theatre burned down in 1613 during a performance of Shakespeare's play \"Henry VIII\" when a cannon misfired and set fire to the thatched roof. However, it was quickly rebuilt on the same site the following year.</p>",

He was born in Oldham, Lancashire and his musical talents were recognized at an early age.</p><p>In his teenage years, Walton studied composition at the University of Oxford with famous British composer Sir Ernest William Moeran. During this time, he gained attention for his talent and caught the eye of influential figures in the music world. In 1922, Walton composed his \"Viola Concerto,\" which marked a significant breakthrough in his career.</p>",

This vibration creates many different types of stringed instruments: <strong>449 </strong>is the number of types of stringed instruments existing in the world.</p>",
            "<p>This number includes, however, many other realities, in particular the world of guitars. Here only the guitar types go up to 42832 different models.</p>",
            "<p>Let\u2019s now take a look at how the sounds of guitar are produced, based on the components of this instrument. Below, you are provided with a table with the different components that make up a guitar.&nbsp;</p>",
            "<p>It can be seen from this table that the material that gives life to this instrument is <strong>wood</strong>. Almost all components are made of wood; in fact, wood is one of the factors that most influences the sound of a guitar. Its quality allows the strings to vibrate differently and determines the tone of the instrument. Yet, is it always just one type of wood? The answer is no. In fact, a specific wood is used for each guitar model. Depending on the model of the guitar (e.g., Ibanez, Fender, etc. ) we will have different types of wood (e.g., poplar wood, maple wood, mahogany wood and rosewood).</p><p>To give an idea of how the wood type look like, an <strong>image </strong>of it is provided by clicking \"Show the image\".</p>",
            "<p>The presence of various types of guitars gives rise to different <strong>market demands</strong>, which vary according to the uses and types most valued by the guitar users. Here, then, two different tables are shown to present the number of acoustic and electric guitars sold over a period of time that goes from 1990 to 2016.</p>",
            "<p>As we can seen, not only do we have a greater number of sales of electric guitars, but more importantly these are concentrated around 1995, a year when rock-n roll had great success, but also around 2016, a year when the rock-n roll revival played an important role in the history of music. From here, the question arises as to what factors influenced these sales: hence, in the chart below the <strong>most influential guitarists </strong>are shown<strong> </strong>who boosted guitars sales.</p>",
            "<p>The influence of the American guitarists has since spread throughout the world and thus, as the map shows, different countries have a higher or lower number of guitarists who have influenced their respective cultures (eg., Fabrizio De Andr\u00e8 in Italy).&nbsp;</p>"

            "The following data story explores the life and works of Johann Sebastian Bach with particular attention to his resonance in contemporary European culture and identity. We indeed believe that, apart from being just cultural products, cultural works (of whatever kind and of whatever genre) contribute to creating an idea of belonging and to shaping a common shared identity, a European one in our case. In the music field, Johann Sebastian Bach was one of those who mostly influenced the creation of a European cultural heritage. This story will be divided into two major parts: in the former we will present some bibliographical data on the composer in order to have a clear presentation on who he was, where he was born, what works he worked on and who he was influenced by; the latter, on the other hand, will deal more with the contemporary resonance that his works had - and still have - in our culture. We will indeed have a look at all those cultural products (concerts, books, films) which still echo Johann Sebastian Bach in contemporary culture.",
            "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: white;\">Bach and his wives (he had two) had a huge family: together they had 20 children, as it can be seen in the counter. Moreover, he travelled little and mainly in Germany and he did not go abroad.&nbsp;</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"color: white;\">In his early life, Bach immediately entered in contact with music since his father already played an instrument and it was probably him who encouraged him to study music. As a matter of fact, in his childhood and as a young man he learnt to play many instruments, as it can be seen below. In his life he was a music teacher, a musicologist, a harpsichordist, a violinist, a choir director, an organist, a concertmaster, a virtuoso and obviously a composer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"color: white;\">Since a young age, Bach started his career as a composer. In his life he composed 25 notable works and 4 famous lists of works.&nbsp;</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"color: white;\">Furthermore, in his life Bach was influenced by other major European authors and composers, suggesting a European spirit and possibly a European cultural identity in progress of formation.&nbsp;</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"color: white;\">Finally, as for his contemporary resonance, we can argue that concerts with Bach\u2019s music are still played and his music is still very much appreciated by contemporary audiences, sometimes without even knowing it (for instance, Piero Angela\u2019s soundtrack of Superquark was Bach\u2019s). Moreover, in the table below we can for example see how his figure is still very much present in present filmography and cinema.&nbsp;</span></p>",
            "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: white;\">To conclude, Johann Sebastian Bach was undoubtedly one of the most decisive composers in 18</span><sup style=\"color: white;\">th</sup><span style=\"color: white;\"> century Europe and he deeply contributed in the formation of a European cultural and musical identity along with Mozart and Beethoven. This story has also demonstrated how his music still speaks volumes to contemporary audiences and had incredible resonance in both the 20</span><sup style=\"color: white;\">th</sup><span style=\"color: white;\"> century as well. We can therefore affirm that this is indicative of his fortune but at the same it shows how he is linked to a European common taste and, as a consequence, also a European sense of belonging.&nbsp;</span></p>"

            "<p><strong>Ludwig van Beethoven was born in December 1770 in Bonn (Germany). </strong></p><p><strong>He came from a humble family with a strong musical background where his father recognised his talent right away and wanted to turn him into the \"next Mozart\". At a very early age he started receiving piano and violin lessons until he became a talented composer, pianist and conductor. During his life he suffered a series of illnesses, including the onset of deafness at 28 which worsened throughout his life until he became completely deaf. Despite this debilitating health condition, he composed 722 works, of which 9 symphonies, 35 piano sonatas and 16 string quartets. He died in Vienna on the 26th of March 1827 and his last words are believed to be \"I will be able to hear in heaven!\". He is one of the greatest classical composers in Western history and his myth still has an influence on today's cultural landscape. </strong></p>",

However, he spent most of his career life in Paris, where he started working at the Op\u00e9ra becoming one of the greatest Italian composers of his age, admired by Cherubini, Beethoven, Weber and Rossini.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Because of the Bourbon Restoration, his works weren't considered as before, leading him to leave Paris for Berlin (at the time under the Kingdom of Prussia), where his operas had already achieved success, where he stayed until 1842.</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">He was a famous composer, conductor and musical director, mainly in the opera field, but also more generally in the music and conducting fields.</span></p>",

            "Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock music that emerged in the 1980s. Its name is derived from \"independent\" as it refers to the independent labels that produced this style of music. This genre is characterized by its non-conformist and do-it-yourself attitude, challenging traditional commercial standards. Indie rock has been associated with a wide range of subgenres, from jangly and upbeat pop-infused sounds to more experimental and introspective styles. Artists like Blur, Sonic Youth and Tame Impala have become iconic figures within the indie rock scene with their unique and innovative approaches. Firstly influenced by UK Rock, Punk Rock, Funk and House, this particular genre continues to grow, embracing new influences and pushing boundaries, while still staying true to its independent roots.",
            "<p>Blur, a British rock band formed in 1988, is renowned as one of the pioneers of the Britpop movement that dominated the UK music scene in the 1990s. Consisting of frontman Damon Albarn, guitarist Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James, and drummer Dave Rowntree, Blur effortlessly combined elements of indie rock, pop, and alternative music, creating a distinct and influential sound.</p>",
            "<p>Their breakthrough came with the release of their third studio album, \"Parklife,\" in 1994. The album marked a significant shift in their style, encapsulating the spirit of British culture and delivering catchy anthems with witty, observational lyrics. The success of \"Parklife\" propelled Blur and the Britpop movement into the mainstream, subsequently leading them to sell millions of records worldwide.</p><p>Today, Blur's legacy as one of the most influential and innovative bands of their era remains undeniable, with their distinctive blend of genres continuing to inspire musicians around the globe</p>",
            "<p>Another influential and innovative band in alternative and indie rock history is the band Sonic Youth. Hailing from New York City, Sonic Youth's unique blend of experimental sounds and unconventional song structures pushed the boundaries of rock music while inspiring generations of musicians. Let's dive into a deeper understanding of this revolutionary band!</p><p>Sonic Youth's founding members are Thurston Moore, Kim Gordon, Lee Ranaldo, and Steve Shelley. Their music had a huge impact on the alternative and grunge scenes of the 90s, influencing bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Smashing Pumpkins. The band worked as pioneer in alternative rock, shaping the future of independent music, and has been central in the democratization of music-making, inspiring artists to explore unconventional sounds and challenge musical norms. From their early noise-driven days to their later experimentation and mainstream success, Sonic Youth consistently pushed boundaries and paved the way for countless artists to follow. Their legacy remains intact, forever changing the landscape of indierock music.</p>",
            "<p>Let us now return to indie rock music. This genre has been gaining more and more popularity in recent years, not only in the US or the UK.

One of them, Gheorghe Zamfir, is famous throughout the world today and helped popularize a traditional Romanian folk instrument, the panpipes.

            "The following data story explores the life and career of one of the most influential and prolific composers of the classical period - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Throughout his 30-year-long career he created a huge number of composition in diverse genres, largely contributing to the enrichment of the western musical heritage. Along with other great composers of the golden era of music, such as Bach and Beethoven, Mozart left an indelible imprint on pages of the world music history, opening the door for several other brilliant composers that had yet to come. In the following data story we will touch upon some biographic data, putting an emphasis on the work activity of Mozart. Finally, we will investigate how Mozart is represented in contemporary culture.",
            "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: transparent;\">His father and sister were artists as well. Leopold Mozart was a musician and he mainly worked at the court of Salzburg, where later his son will work too. Leopold recognised his son\u2019s talent since he was a child and he made sure his son was known in the major courts of Europe. The Mozart family traveled a lot, however Wolfgang Mozart ended up working mainly in Salzburg and Wien. .&nbsp;</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: transparent;\">Mozart married Constanze Weber and they had two children</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: transparent;\">Mozart died young: he was only 35 years old, In his 26 years of activity he managed to create an enormous amount of masterpieces, which inspired his successors, e.g. Wagner and Beethoven. With his overall work he established a bridge between the Classical and Romantic music movements.</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: transparent;\">In some of his works, however, it is possible to trace the influence of other great composers of his time.</span></p>",

            "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: transparent;\">As the following table shows , the life and works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart still represent a source of interest and entertainment: many movies, screenplays, tv series and books are made on his figure, his short but eventful life and on his evergreen music. </span></p>"

            "This study aims at displaying the music organizations in the MusicBo corpus. In particular, we focused on the organizations in Bologna, while uncovering the dominance of violinists within the music scene in the XVIII century.",
            "<p>The total number of organizations found in the MusicBo corpus is 307, mostly being music schools, academies, churches and operas.</p>",
            "<p>As a matter of fact, here we can observe the most mentioned organizations. Amongst them, organizations found in Bologna prevail, given to the fact that the corpus focuses on this city and the role of music there.</p>",
            "<p>Let\u2019s take a closer look at the organizations in Bologna, where the most various organisations are discovered, going from classical academies to the notable Cathedral of San Petronio.</p>",
            "<p>Which Bologna-based organization is the most cited and popular?</p>",
            "<p>The Philharmonic Academy of Bologna is the most mentioned one, given its high status in the Bolognese music panorama between the XVII and XVIII centuries. Its success was especially given by the high-profile members, such as the composer Giacomo Antonio Perti or the renowned violinist Giuseppe Torelli.</p>",
            "<p>The Baroque Concerto, A.J.B. Hutchings (1961) from the MusicBo corpus:</p><p>\"<em>After his Italian tour of 1770, Burney wrote of Torelli: ' This author, who was a member of the Philharmonic Academy of Bologna and the first violin of the church of San Petronio in the same city, published seven different works for violin</em>.\"</p><p>Let\u2019s look at an overview of Torelli\u2019s life.</p>",
            "<p>Violinists like Torelli had a crucial role in the music scene of the XVIII century, since the violin was one of the most played instruments thanks to its sound harmony and grace, perfectly fit for classical music.</p><p>Look at how many violinists existed during this time!</p>",
            "<p>Compared to other players, such as pianists, flutists, guitarists, violists and drummers, violinists were of great importance in classical music and were much more required. The MusicBo corpus has evidence of the popularity of violinists:</p><p>The Baroque Concerto, A.J.B. Hutchings (1961)</p><p>\"<em>bassoonists, flautists and oboists who are less richly served with concertos than are violinists and pianists, but prove that we have yet to explore a field of French concertos in which there are works as attractive as Telemann's, which they notably influenced, and sometimes quite as distinguished by technical skill</em>.\"</p><p>Take a glance at the rise to fame of the violinists through this line chart! It provides a clear depiction of how their popularity has grown over time.</p>",
            "<p>But what was the citizenship of the violinists of the XVIII century?</p>",
            "<p>Europe had a notable larger number of violinists than the rest of the world, due to the fact that classical music was born in France and therefore it mostly expanded in countries of Northern Europe. France, England, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and Italy welcome the majority of violinists of the XVIII century. The MusicBo corpus provides an explanation for the growing presence of violinists between the XVII and the XVIII centuries, as shown by the following sentences:</p><p>OUTLANDISH AUTHORS: INNOCENZO FEDE AND MUSICAL PATRONAGE AT THE STUART COURT IN LONDON AND IN EXILE, Nicholas Ezra Field (2013)</p><p>\"<em>The experience of the violin in England was transformed in 1656 with the arrival of Thomas Baltzar, a German violinist recently employed in Sweden at the court Queen dissemination of the violin and its court repertoire into the wider musical community was, of course, the Civil War</em>.\"</p><p>OUTLANDISH AUTHORS: INNOCENZO FEDE AND MUSICAL PATRONAGE AT THE STUART COURT IN LONDON AND IN EXILE, Nicholas Ezra Field (2013)</p><p>\"<em>The 1773 arrival of Mary and her Italian courtiers nearly coincided with an explosion of popular interest in Italian music caused in large part by the performances of violinist Nicola Matteis, who had appeared in London around 1670 and struggled briefly for recognition before achieving fame around 1672.106 North wrote, \u201cthis poor Man as a gratefull legacy to the English Nation left with them a generall favour for the Itallian Manner of Harmony, and after him the French was wholly lay\u2019d aside</em>.\"</p><p>The Baroque Concerto, A.J.B. Hutchings (1961)</p><p>\"<em>Geminiani was one of the finest violinists of his generation, and he came to England at a time when the example and teaching of a great violinist was badly needed</em>.\"</p><p>If we want to find out which violinists are from a given city, we can check by entering the name of a city and discover who was born there. If available, we will also see some biographical information and an image depicting the artist.</p>"

As far as this project is concerned, we have provided an overview of the members of the 27 Club, but with a particular focus on musicians and singers.",
            "<h1>The cultural phenomenon of the 27 Club</h1><p>A sense of unease surrounds the history of the so-called 27 Club, a group of young talented musicians, mainly rockstars, who are united by a sudden and premature death. We all know the most famous of them: Kurt Cobain, lead singer of Nirvana who committed suicide, Jim Morrison, frontman of The Doors who died of an overdose, as well as Amy Winehouse and Janis Joplin, Brian Jones and Jimi Hendrix. But there are more of them. It would be therefore interesting to look into this creepy Club, that has now turned into a cultural phenomenon, in order to know more about its members.</p><p>If you want to have more details about the 27 Club, please click <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>"

They became known for their biting political, social and emotional commentary.",
            "<p><span style=\"color: black;\">The band was born back to 1963 thanks to the meeting of three architecture students from the University of London, Roger Waters, Nick Mason e Richard Wright. At first, the band didn\u2019t have the unique name with which everyone knows them, but they changed it several times: for example, they used to call themselves Spectrum Five, Tea Set, etc. Finally, they switched to Pink Floyd in 1965, combining the names of two bluesmen, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council.</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"color: black;\">Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene. They rapidly achieved great success and they were always keen on exploring more into various music genres. In fact, they were the founders of two major music movements: psychedelic space-rock and blues-based progressive rock.</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"color: black;\">Pink Floyd are known for their wide range of instruments, which belong to different genres and are combined harmoniously to create their songs. Moreover, it\u2019s notorious their use of non-musical sounds, a distinctive feature of the band. Pink Floyd are masters in creating atmospheres, anticipating situations, and giving sensations.&nbsp;</span></p>",
            "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">On March 1983 Pink Floyd released The Final Cut, the band\u2019s last album with Roger Waters. From this moment, the bassist will separate from his bandmates to pursue a solo career. In fact, he still tours to sing the band\u2019s most renowned songs in many countries around the world including Italy, where he exhibited in Bologna last April.</span></p>",
            "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Although Pink Floyd were born in the 60s, they have always been open to innovation, and not only from a musical perspective. Indeed with the digital era they joined the social media, and nowadays they are still very influential and have lots of followers.</span></p>"

            "The aim of our story is to present some information about the piano and to look more closely at the story of one of the world's best-known pianists, Ludwig van Beethoven. The piano is one of the most popular instruments and the most harmonically complete one but, at the same time, it is also the most challenging to master. The piano was invented by the Italian Bartolomeo Cristofori around 1700. However, before his invention, the piano had precursors such as the clavichord, harpsichord and dulcimer.

His groundbreaking symphonies, sonatas, concertos, and chamber music compositions have left an enduring impact on the development of classical music. Beyond his compositional ability, Beethoven's artistic vision was fueled by his desire to convey profound human experiences and universal truths through music.

            "This project will be about one of the best Italian singer songwirter from Bologna: Lucio Dalla. He was of the best Italian singer-songwriters. As a substantial part of Italian culture, we will analyze his life and works.",
            "<p>Lucio Dalla was an Italian singer-songwriter, musician, and actor, widely regarded as one of the most influential and popular figures in Italian music. Born on March 4, 1943, in Bologna, Italy, he became an iconic and beloved artist.</p><p>From an early age, Lucio Dalla displayed a passion for music. He started playing the clarinet as a child and later picked up the saxophone, which would become his signature instrument. During his teenage years, he performed with several local bands, exploring various musical genres, including jazz and rock.</p><p>In the early 1960s, Dalla embarked on his professional music career, initially working as a session musician and songwriter for other artists. However, it was in the 1970s that he gained widespread recognition and popularity as a solo artist. His breakthrough came with the release of the \u201cTerra di Gaibola\u201d album in 1970, which featured the hit single \"4 marzo 1943.\" The song, a poignant tribute to the victims of the Bologna massacre during World War II, resonated deeply with the Italian public and established Dalla as a socially conscious and introspective songwriter.</p><p>Lucio Dalla's music spanned various genres throughout his career, blending elements of pop, rock, jazz, and traditional Italian music. His lyrical prowess and ability to capture human emotions in his songs earned him critical acclaim and a loyal fanbase. Dalla's discography includes numerous successful albums, such as \"Automobili\" (1976), \"Dalla\" (1980), and \"Cambio\" (1990).</p><p>One of Lucio Dalla's most iconic and enduring songs is \"Caruso,\" released in 1986. The ballad, inspired by the life of the legendary Italian tenor Enrico Caruso, became an international hit and solidified Dalla's status as a prominent figure in Italian music. His powerful vocal performance and heartfelt delivery in \"Caruso\" touched the hearts of listeners worldwide, transcending language barriers.</p><p>Dalla also ventured into acting. He appeared in several films, including \"Luna\" (1979) and \"To Forget Venice\" (1979), showcasing his versatile talents on the big screen. Moreover, he collaborated with various artists throughout his career, both as a songwriter and performer, including renowned Italian singer-songwriter Francesco De Gregori.</p><p>Sadly, on March 1, 2012, Lucio Dalla passed away unexpectedly at the age of 68 while on tour in Switzerland. His untimely death shocked the music world and prompted an outpouring of tributes from fans and fellow artists. Dalla's legacy, however, continues to live on through his timeless music, which remains beloved by generations of listeners.</p><p>If you want to discover more about his life and works <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucio_Dalla\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a></p>"

The Five revolutionized the Russian music scene of the 19th century.</p>",

            "<p>Click here to listen to one of their works!</p>",
            "<p>The Five were the prominent composers of the 19th century in Russia. As a matter of fact, they introduced their country to a distinct national style of classical music, and they had so much influence on the music scene of the time, that many Russian artists followed their lead, and the practice of classical music grew exponentially. Look at how many Russian composition groups can be found after the guidance of The Five!</p>",
            "<p>As you can see from the line chart, the 1800s was a flourishing period for classical music in Russia. And guess what? We owe it all to Emperor <strong>Peter the Great</strong>, whose openness to Europe brought the whole musical scene to Russia.</p><p>There is another peak, during the Soviet Union. You're probably wondering, why? Among the followers of the Five, we find the most popular Soviet composers. We're talking about legends, including <strong>Shostakovich</strong>, <strong>Prokofiev</strong>, and <strong>Stravinsky</strong>.</p>",
            "<p>How about the <strong>rest of the world</strong>? Did composers thrive the most during the 19th century also in other countries? Let\u2019s find out by seeing how many composers can be found in each country during the 1800s.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

            "This project will be about one of the best Italian singer songwirter from Bologna: Cesare Cremonini. He was of the best Italian singer-songwriters. As a substantial part of Italian culture, we will analyze his life and works.",
            "<p>Cesare Cremonini is an Italian singer-songwriter and musician who has gained widespread acclaim for his soulful voice, introspective lyrics, and captivating melodies. Born on March 27, 1980, in Bologna, Italy, Cremonini developed a passion for music at a young age and embarked on a remarkable journey that would establish him as one of the most prominent figures in the Italian music industry.</p><p>Growing up in a family that appreciated the arts, Cesare Cremonini was exposed to various musical genres from an early age. He began playing the piano at the age of six and quickly discovered his innate talent for music. As he honed his skills, Cremonini started writing his own songs, showcasing his creativity and knack for storytelling.</p><p>In 1996, Cremonini formed the band Senza Filtro with some of his friends; its name was changed in L\u00f9napop in 1997. The group gained much popularity, thanks to their infectious pop-rock sound and catchy songs. Their debut album, \"...Squ\u00e9rez?\" released in 1999, became a commercial success in Italy and spawned several hit singles. Cesare's distinctive voice and charismatic stage presence quickly made him a fan favorite.</p><p>However, despite the band's success, Cesare Cremonini felt the need to pursue a solo career to explore his artistic vision further. In 2002, he released his first solo album, \"Bagus,\" which showcased a more introspective and mature sound compared to his earlier work with L\u00f9napop. The album received critical acclaim, and Cremonini's solo career was off to a promising start.</p><p>Over the following years, Cesare Cremonini continued to release a string of successful albums, each displaying his growth as an artist and his ability to connect with audiences on a profound level. His music became known for its emotional depth, tackling love, loss, and personal introspection themes. Cremonini's distinctive voice, characterized by its soulful timbre and emotive delivery, further solidified his position as one of Italy's most beloved musicians.</p><p>Some of his most notable albums include \"Maggese\" (2005), \"1999-2010 The Greatest Hits\" (2010), \"La teoria dei colori\" (2012), and \"Possibili Scenari\" (2017). These albums spawned numerous chart-topping singles, earning Cremonini numerous awards and accolades throughout his career.</p><p>Beyond his musical accomplishments, Cesare Cremonini is known for his philanthropic endeavors and dedication to social causes. He has been involved in various charitable initiatives, using his platform and resources to positively impact society.</p><p>If you want to learn more on Cremonini's life and works please <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Cremonini_(musician)\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a></p>"

After a general exploration of the WikiData knowledge base with the aim to discover the quantity of people and artists in comparison with MusicBO, we will then narrow down our research analyzing the composers recorded in WikiData, to eventually focus on our main object of the story: Gaspare Spontini. In particular, the story will present an overview of his biography, his occupations and fields of work, as well as the awards he received during his life, the academy where he worked and the cities where he lived. At the end of the story, there will be an insight into the Museum Gaspare Spontini, its location and the visitors he had per year.",

            "This project has the aim to investigate the popularity of rock bands and rock singers born in Emilia Romagna. The investigation retrieves information from the Wikidata corpus and takes into account Twitter followers of famous rock singers and rock bands born in the Emilia Romagna region after 1940. Furthermore, the project provides the reader with images, charts, tables and maps in order to better understand the impact and popularity of the most famous rock musicians and bands formed in Emilia Romagna.",
            "<p>Firstly, let\u2019s take a look at the number of rock singers born in Emilia Romagna after 1940. Our aim was to investigate the popularity of rock music in Emilia Romagna and their ongoing impact. That is why we decided to rule out singers who were born before 1940. Moreover, we wanted to understand how many singers can be considered to belong to the rock genre according to the Wikidata corpus.</p>",
            "<p>As we can see, the Wikidata corpus does not retrieve many rock singers born in Emilia Romagna. Without adding the property \u201csubclass of\u201d Wikidata only finds 8 singers. That is why we thought that by adding said property we would be able to get more results. Unfortunately, if we include other subclasses of \u201csinger\u201d such as \u201csongwriter\u201d or \u201cmusician\u201d we only get 1 more result.</p><p>Now let\u2019s observe who are the first 10 rock singers born in Emilia Romagna after 1940, ordered from the oldest to the youngest. This table provides us with the singers' full name, their birthdate, their birthplace, their sex and, if available, an image of each singer.</p>",
            "<p>With this research we wanted to understand who are the 9 rock singers present in the Wikidata corpus. Moreover, we wanted to observe their birthdate, birthplace and sex. We also decided to include an image, if available. One of the most interesting observations we made is the fact that there is only one female singer in this list, Laura Pausini. This highlights the fact that in Emilia Romagna it is easier to find male rather than female rock singers.</p><p>Now let\u2019s take a look at a doughnut chart containing the first 7 genres in Emilia Romagna after 1940 according to the number of singers. This query is useful to investigate the impact and popularity of rock music compared to other music genres.</p>",
            "<p>The results show us that rock music is not the most popular genre in Emilia Romagna. Pop music is at the top with 23 singers, whereas rock music is actually in second place with only 9 singers. What is interesting is the fact that the third most popular genre is opera music (6 singers). In fact, this genre seems to be even more popular than pop rock music (only 1 singer), according to the Wikidata corpus.</p><p>After focusing mainly on rock singers, let\u2019s take a look at a list of rock bands formed in Emilia Romagna (after 1940). This research provides us with the name of the band, its date and city of formation and, if available, an image of the band.</p>",
            "<p>The results show us that there are more rock bands (21) than rock singers (9) according to the Wikidata corpus. Moreover, more than half of them were formed in Bologna.</p><p>Now we aim at showing in which city rock singers and rock bands were born. Indeed, we want to verify which is the province with the highest number of rock artists and which is the one with the lowest.&nbsp;</p>",
            "<p>As we can state from our results there are 2 rock artists in the province of Piacenza, 5 in the province of Parma, 4 in the province of Reggio Emilia, 6 in the province of Modena, 14 in the province of Bologna, 1 in the province of Ravenna, 1 in the province of Forl\u00ec-Cesena and 1 in the province of Rimini. Therefore, Bologna is the province with the highest number of rock singers and groups in Emilia-Romagna. On the other hand, Rimini is the province with the lowest number of rock artists.</p><p>Now let\u2019s focus on their Twitter followers. First of all, we\u2019ve decided to take a look at the number of Twitter followers of rock singers born in Emilia-Romagna after 1940. Then, we\u2019ve decided to compare the previous results with the number of Twitter followers of rock bands born in Emilia-Romagna after 1940. We want to verify if rock singers actually have more followers than rock bands since rock bands tend to be more world famous than singers.</p>",
            "<p>The results show us that Twitter followers of rock singers are 787.933. Therefore, rock singers have more Twitter followers than rock bands. This result is surprising due to the fact that rock bands are usually more well-known than singers and when we think about rock music in general, bands are the first to come to mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, let\u2019s take a look at a barchart showing us who are the singers and bands with the highest number of followers on Twitter.</p>",
            "<p>Luciano Ligabue appears to be the most followed artist on Twitter in Emilia-Romagna. Besides, the second one is Laura Pausini. The former is a rock singer, meanwhile the latter belongs to the music genre pop-rock that is a subcategory of rock music. Vasco Rossi is the third artist mentioned, although there is a significant difference in the number of followers between him and Laura Pausini. The remaining artists are presented in the following order: Zucchero, Neck, Pooh, Lo Stato Sociale, Helia, Marta sui Tubi and Alessandro Cortini. The presence of Laura Pausini as the only female singer in the above-mentioned chart is noteworthy since we tend to believe that there are more male rock artists than female. Furthermore, four out of ten names are male bands, that are Pooh, Lo Stato Sociale, Helia and Marta sui Tubi. Lastly, Alessandro Corsini is the only composer and music producer present in the chart.</p>"

            "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">First of all, let's have a look at the </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(217, 217, 217);\">list of musical artists from Emilia-Romagna</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">. Below is a partial list of the musical artists that Emilia-Romagna has given us, taken from </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(217, 217, 217);\">DBpedia</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\"> and arranged chronologically by year of birth. Look at the table to discover their places of birth, the exact dates of birth and to see the reference images.</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">The DBpedia database</span><strong style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\"> </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">provides the </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(217, 217, 217);\">length of the corresponding Wikipedia page</strong><strong style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\"> </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">for each artist. Therefore, we wonder whether this length might be a good indicator of the level of popularity of the musical artist abroad. Indeed, the Wikipedia pages considered are in English. Below we provide the ranking of the TOP 10 artists according to the number of characters on the corresponding Wikipedia page.</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">The results show that </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(217, 217, 217);\">Raffaella Carr\u00e0</strong><strong style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\"> </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">has the longest and most detailed Wikipedia page, by a considerable margin over all the others. In fact, the number of characters on her page is more than double that of the second artist on the list, the singer Nek. While Raffaella Carr\u00e0's popularity is unquestionable, as she is internationally loved, it is plausible to speculate that other factors, such as the fact that her life is already over, explain the data obtained.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">Let's now explore another possible measure of artists' popularity by looking at which musical artists have the </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(217, 217, 217);\">highest number of mentions</strong><strong style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\"> </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">(always accompanied by a hyperlink) </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(217, 217, 217);\">on Wikipedia</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">. Below is the ranking of the TOP 10 artists based on this new criterion.</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">We observe a clear difference with the results of the previous query. </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(217, 217, 217);\">Lucio Dalla</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\"> is now the most cited Emilian musical artist on other Wikipedia pages. This may suggest the fact that Lucio Dalla participated in more cultural events than other Emilian artists.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">Knowing the prestige and popularity of the Sanremo Festival in Italy, we will check the number of times Dalla has been cited on the </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(217, 217, 217);\">Wikipedia pages of Sanremo Festivals</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\"> over the years and compare it with the number of times Carr\u00e0 has been cited on the same pages.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">Of course, it has to be taken into account that Dalla participated in the Sanremo Festival six times, while Carr\u00e0 only took part in it three times.</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">To conclude the research, we looked at the popularity of other Italian singers, this time </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(217, 217, 217);\"><em>not</em></strong><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\"> born in Emilia-Romagna. The aim was to compare the new data with the previous results obtained specifically for this region, in order to obtain a </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(217, 217, 217);\">more complete assessment</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(217, 217, 217);\"> </span><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">of the popularity of the musical artists and its correlation with the number of online mentions.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(204, 204, 204);\">For this reason, the number of mentions of other Italian musical artists in Wikipedia is reported below, as well as the length of their own Wikipedia pages in terms of number of characters.</span></p>"

Because of the migration of many former slaves and their descendants to major urban centers such as St. Louis, Memphis, New York City, Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, and Buffalo, black and white residents were living in closer proximity than ever before, hearing each other's music and even beginning to emulate each other's fashions. This process of \"cultural collision\" was facilitated by radio stations that made white and black forms of music available to both populations, the development and distribution of the vinyl record, and African-American musical styles such as jazz and swing that were adopted by white performers."
